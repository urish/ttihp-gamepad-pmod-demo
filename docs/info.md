## How it works

This project demonstrates how to use the Gamepad Pmod to get input from a gamepad and display it on a VGA monitor.

## How to test

Connect the TinyVGA and Gamepad Pmods to the Tiny Tapeout board, activate the project, reset it, and start pressing buttons on the gamepad.

When you press a button on the gamepad, its corresponding symbol will appear in green on the VGA display.
